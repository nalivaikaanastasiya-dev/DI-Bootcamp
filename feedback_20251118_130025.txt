suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 2 is missing. The instructions ask to create two files, func.py and exercise_one.py, and import the function from one to the other. This exercise is not implemented.
- There's a typo in Exercise 7: `user.uppend(user_data)` should be `users.append(user_data)`.
- In Exercise 7, initialize the users list before defining the `generate_fake_users` function to adhere to better practices.
- In Exercise 1, it's good to handle `NotImplemented` in `__add__` and `__iadd__` by returning `NotImplemented` to allow other objects to handle the operation.  You could also check the type of `other` before attempting operations that will raise an error.
