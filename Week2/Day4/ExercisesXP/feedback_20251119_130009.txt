suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling, especially for edge cases in file handling and JSON operations.
- Add comments to improve understanding of the code's intent, particularly in complex sections like nested JSON access.
- While the code includes error messages, ensure they are user-friendly and guide the user on how to resolve the issue.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code directly and accurately addresses the problems outlined in the chapter content, implementing file handling, data structures, random number generation, string manipulation, and JSON operations as required by exercises 1 and 2. All instructions are followed.
- readability: The code is well-structured with clear function definitions and variable names, but could benefit from additional comments to explain complex logic and assumptions. Consistent naming conventions and proper indentation are used throughout the code.
- performance: The code uses efficient methods for reading files, generating random sentences, and manipulating JSON data. The random sentence generation algorithm has a linear time complexity with respect to the sentence length. Overall performance is appropriate for the given tasks.
- security: The code implements basic error handling to prevent crashes due to file not found or invalid user inputs. It uses `try-except` blocks to catch potential exceptions and exit gracefully. No significant security vulnerabilities are apparent in the code.
