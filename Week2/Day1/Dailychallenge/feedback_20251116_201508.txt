suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comments to explain complex logic, especially in `get_short_info`.
- String formatting in `get_info` could be slightly improved for better alignment with different terminal widths, though it fulfills the requirements.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements all the required functionality: creating the `Farm` class with `__init__`, `add_animal` (including the `**kwargs` upgrade), `get_info`, `get_animal_types`, and `get_short_info` methods. The output matches the expected output in the prompt.
- readability: The code is generally well-readable. The use of descriptive variable names and the clear structure of the methods enhance readability. However, more comments in complex functions like `get_short_info` can further improve readability.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given task. The dictionary lookups and list sorting are standard operations and are used appropriately. The string concatenation, especially in `get_info`, could be potentially optimized for very large farms, but it is acceptable for this scenario. The `add_animal` method uses `.get()` for setting the default which has O(1) complexity.
- security: The code does not have any obvious security vulnerabilities. There's no external input being directly executed or any file operations that could be exploited. Input validation for the animal names is not specified in the prompt, so it's not a missing security measure.
