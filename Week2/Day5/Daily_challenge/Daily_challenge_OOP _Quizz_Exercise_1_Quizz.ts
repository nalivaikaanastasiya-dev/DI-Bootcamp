1.  *Class: A blueprint or a template for creating objects (instances). It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the created object will possess.
2.  *Instance: An individual realization of a class. When you create an object from a class, that object is called an instance.
3.  *Encapsulation: The bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (the class). It also involves restricting direct access to some components. 
4.  *Abstraction: The process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object to the user. It focuses on *what* the object does, rather than *how* it does it.
5.  *Inheritance: A mechanism that allows a new class (subclass/child class) to derive attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass/parent class).
6.  *Multiple Inheritance: A feature where a class can inherit properties and methods from more than one parent class.
7.  *Polymorphism: The ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, it often refers to methods that have the same name but behave differently based on the object or context (e.g., method overriding or overloading). 
8.  *Method Resolution Order (MRO): The sequence in which Python searches for a method in a class hierarchy, especially in the case of multiple inheritance. MRO ensures a deterministic order for method calling and is based on the C3 linearisation algorithm.
