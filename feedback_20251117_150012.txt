suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `Cat` class should inherit directly from object and not from `Pets`. The attributes of the `Cat` class and its subclasses should be handled correctly without the unnecessary 'animals' attribute in the init method.
- Exercise 1: Consider if `sing()` method actually takes sound parameter. Should it be passed when calling it?
- Exercise 3 is missing. It should be added.
- Exercise 1: The classes' names should start with uppercase.
- Exercise 2: Could use the formatting option in fight to show 2 digits after the dot.
- Exercise 4: Change for loop to break when person is found in check_majority function to improve speed.
