# You were hired to help a small coffee shop manage their product menu using Python.

# Write a program that:

# 1. Stores the coffee shop menu in memory
# 2. Lets the user:

# Create a new item
# Read (view) all items
# Update an item’s price
# Delete an item
# Exit
# Your program must be organized with functions.
# Do not write all the logic in one giant while loop.
# You should split behavior into reusable functions.



# 1. Data structure
# We will represent the menu using a dictionary called menu.

# The key is the drink name (string)
# The value is the price (float)
# Example starting data (you MUST start with this so tests are consistent):

# menu = {
#     "espresso": 7.0,
#     "latte": 12.0,
#     "cappuccino": 10.0
# }


# 2. Required functions
# You must implement the following functions.

# a) show_menu(menu_dict)
# Input: the dictionary
# Output: prints all items in the format drink - price₪
# If the menu is empty, print: "The menu is empty."
# Example:

# Current menu:
# espresso - 7.0₪
# latte - 12.0₪
# cappuccino - 10.0₪
# This function only prints. It does not return anything.



# b) add_item(menu_dict)
# Ask the user for:
# drink name
# price
# Add it to the dictionary.
# If the drink already exists, print "Item already exists!" and do not change the price.
# Example interaction:

# Enter new drink name: mocha
# Enter price: 14
# "mocha" added!
# This function mutates the dictionary. It does not return anything.



# c) update_price(menu_dict)
# Ask the user which drink they want to update.
# If it exists:
# ask for the new price
# update it
# print: "Price updated!"
# If it doesn’t exist:
# print: "Item not found."


# d) delete_item(menu_dict)
# Ask the user which drink to remove.
# If it exists:
# delete it from the dict
# print: "Item deleted."
# Otherwise:
# print: "Item not found."


# e) show_options()
# Prints the main menu of actions for the user:
# What would you like to do?
# 1. Show menu
# 2. Add item
# 3. Update price
# 4. Delete item
# 5. Exit
# Only prints. Doesn’t return anything.



# f) run_coffee_shop()
# This is the main controller of the program.

# Behavior:

# Keep running in a loop.
# Show options.
# Ask the user to choose (1-5).
# Depending on the choice, call the correct function.


# Rules:

# Invalid choice → print "Invalid choice, try again."
# Choice 5 stops the loop and prints "Goodbye!"


# 3. Program flow (example)
# This is what using the program might look like when it runs:

# What would you like to do?
# 1. Show menu
# 2. Add item
# 3. Update price
# 4. Delete item
# 5. Exit
# > 1
# Current menu:
# espresso - 7.0₪
# latte - 12.0₪
# cappuccino - 10.0₪

# What would you like to do?
# 1. Show menu
# 2. Add item
# 3. Update price
# 4. Delete item
# 5. Exit
# > 2
# Enter new drink name: mocha
# Enter price: 14
# "mocha" added!

# What would you like to do?
# 1. Show menu
# 2. Add item
# 3. Update price
# 4. Delete item
# 5. Exit
# > 3
# Which drink do you want to update? latte
# Enter the new price: 13
# Price updated!

# What would you like to do?
# 1. Show menu
# 2. Add item
# 3. Update price
# 4. Delete item
# 5. Exit
# > 4
# Which drink do you want to delete? espresso
# Item deleted!

# What would you like to do?
# 1. Show menu
# 2. Add item
# 3. Update price
# 4. Delete item
# 5. Exit
# > 1
# Current menu:
# latte - 13.0₪
# cappuccino - 10.0₪
# mocha - 14.0₪

# What would you like to do?
# 1. Show menu
# 2. Add item
# 3. Update price
# 4. Delete item
# 5. Exit
# > 5
# Goodbye!


# 4. Starter template (students fill in the TODOs)
# # Coffee Shop Menu Manager

# # Initial data
# menu = {
#     "espresso": 7.0,
#     "latte": 12.0,
#     "cappuccino": 10.0
# }

# def show_menu(menu_dict):
#     """Print all drinks and prices."""
#     pass



# def add_item(menu_dict):
#     """Add a new drink to the menu."""
#     pass


# def update_price(menu_dict):
#     """Change the price of an existing drink."""
#     pass


# def delete_item(menu_dict):
#     """Remove a drink from the menu."""
#     pass

#     # TODO
#     # while True:
#     #   1. show_options()
#     #   2. get user choice
#     #   3. if 1 -> show_menu(menu)
#     #      if 2 -> add_item(menu)
#     #      if 3 -> update_price(menu)
#     #      if 4 -> delete_item(menu)

#     #      else -> "Invalid choice, try again."
#     pass


# # Start the program
# run_coffee_shop()


# 5. Extra challenges (only if they finish early)
# Ask fast students to add one or more:

# 1. Validation:
# Don’t allow negative prices. If the user enters -5, print "Invalid price." and don’t change anything.

# 2. Search function:
# Add a function search_item(menu_dict) that asks for a drink name and:

# prints the price if found
# else prints "Not in the menu."
# Then add it as option 6 in the menu.
# 3. Discount day:
# Add a function apply_discount(menu_dict, percent) that reduces every price by a percentage.
# Example: apply_discount(menu, 10) makes 10% off happy hour.
