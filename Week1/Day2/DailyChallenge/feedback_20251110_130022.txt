suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comments to further enhance readability, especially within the loops.
- Input validation could be added to handle non-integer inputs for the first challenge, preventing potential errors.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements both challenges as described in the chapter content. It correctly calculates multiples for Challenge 1 and removes consecutive duplicates in Challenge 2, matching all examples provided.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward. The inclusion of comments explaining each step improves readability.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given tasks. The loops are optimized to iterate only as needed, and string manipulation is done effectively.
- security: The code is reasonably secure. Using `int(input())` helps prevent some basic injection attacks, and there are no obvious vulnerabilities.
