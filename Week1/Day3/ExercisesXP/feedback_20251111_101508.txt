suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comments to explain complex logic, especially within the Zara exercise.
- Use more descriptive variable names where appropriate to improve understanding.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements all exercises as described in the Chapter Content/Questions, including dictionary creation, manipulation, loops, and conditionals. The expected outputs are achieved for each exercise.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. Consistent naming conventions and proper indentation contribute to readability.  Minor improvements can be made with additional comments.
- performance: The code uses efficient methods like `zip` and dictionary comprehensions, resulting in good performance.  The algorithms used are appropriate for the size of the data.
- security: The code doesn't involve any user input that could pose a security risk, and there are no apparent vulnerabilities.
